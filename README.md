# snakemake-tutorial-argo-workflows

My adaptation of the [Snakemake tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html) with Argo Workflows

This adaptation covers only the [Basics: An example workflow](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/basics.html) section of "Tutorial: General use", minus the histogram plot in "Step 6: Using custom scripts".

**DISCLAIMER: the setup in this repository is insecure and must NOT be used in a production environment!**
